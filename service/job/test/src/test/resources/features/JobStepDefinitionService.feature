Feature: Job step definition service CRUD tests
  The Job Step Definition service is responsible for maintaining job step definitions.
  During regular runtime the step definitions are automatically extracted from the various
  service implementations.

  @KapuaProperties("locator.class.impl=org.eclipse.kapua.qa.common.MockedLocator")
  Scenario: Initialize test environment
    Given Init Jaxb Context
    And Init Security Context

  Scenario: Regular step definition creation

    Given A regular definition creator with the name "TestDefinition" and 3 properties

      | name  | type | value |
      | prop1 | t1   | 123   |
      | prop2 | t1   | 123   |
      | prop3 | t1   | 123   |
    When I create a new step definition entity from the existing creator
    Then No exception was thrown

  Scenario: Step definition with a null scope ID

    Given A null scope
    Given A regular step definition creator with the name "TestDefinition"

    When I create a new step definition entity from the existing creator
    Then An exception was thrown

  Scenario: Step definition with a null name

    Given A regular step definition creator with the name "TestDefinition"
    And I set the step definition creator name to null
    Given I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "name"
    When I create a new step definition entity from the existing creator
    Then An exception was thrown

  Scenario: Step definition with an empty name

    Given A regular step definition creator with the name ""
    Given I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "name"
    When I create a new step definition entity from the existing creator
    Then An exception was thrown

  Scenario: Step definition with a duplicate name

    Given A regular step definition creator with the name "TestDefinition"
    When I create a new step definition entity from the existing creator
    Given I expect the exception "KapuaDuplicateNameInAnotherAccountError" with the text "An entity with the same name TestDefinition already exists."
    And I create a new step definition entity from the existing creator
    Then An exception was thrown

  Scenario: Delete a step definition

    Given A regular step definition creator with the name "TestDefinition"
    When I create a new step definition entity from the existing creator
    When I search for the step definition in the database
    And The step definition entity matches the creator
    When I delete the step definition
    And I search for the step definition in the database
    Then There is no such step definition item in the database

  Scenario: Delete a step definition twice

    Given A regular step definition creator with the name "TestDefinition"
    When I create a new step definition entity from the existing creator
