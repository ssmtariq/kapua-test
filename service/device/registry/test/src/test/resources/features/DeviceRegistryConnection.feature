Feature: Device Registry Connection tests
    The Device Registry Connection service is responsible for performing CRUD operations
    regarding device connections on the Kapua database.

@setup
@KapuaProperties("locator.class.impl=org.eclipse.kapua.qa.common.MockedLocator")
Scenario: Initialize test environment
    Given Init Jaxb Context
    And Init Security Context

Scenario: Regular connection
    It must be possible to create a device connection entry in the database. The entry
    must match the creator parameters. The connection status must also be
    implicitly set to CONNECTED.

    Given The User ID 1
    And Scope with ID 1
    And I have the following connection
        | clientId    | clientIp    | serverIp   | protocol | allowUserChange   |
        | testClient1 | 127.0.0.101 | 127.0.0.10 | tcp      | true              |
    Then The connection object is regular
    And The connection details match
        | clientId    | clientIp    | serverIp   | protocol | allowUserChange   |
        | testClient1 | 127.0.0.101 | 127.0.0.10 | tcp      | true              |
    And The connection status is "CONNECTED"

Scenario: Device connection update
    It must be possible to change the data of an existing device connection database
    entry.

    Given The User ID 1
    And Scope with ID 1
    And I have the following connection
        | clientId    | clientIp    | serverIp   | protocol | allowUserChange   |
        | testClient1 | 127.0.0.101 | 127.0.0.10 | tcp      | true              |
    When I modify the connection details to
        | clientIp    | serverIp   | protocol | allowUserChange   |
        | 127.0.0.109 | 127.0.0.25 | udp      | true              |
    Then No exception was thrown
    And The connection details match
        | clientIp    | serverIp   | protocol | allowUserChange   |
        | 127.0.0.109 | 127.0.0.25 | udp      | true              |

Scenario: Try to modify the connection client ID
    It must not be possible to change the client ID of an existing device connection.
    Attempts to change the client ID must be silently ignored. No exceptions must
    be thrown.

    Given The User ID 1
    And Scope with ID 1
    And I have the following connection
        | clientId    | clientIp    | serverIp   | protocol | allowUserChange   |
        | testClient1 | 127.0.0.101 | 127.0.0.10 | tcp      | true              |
    When I try to modify the connection client Id to "testClient2"
    Then No exception was thrown
    And The connection client ID remains unchanged

Scenario: Count connections in scope
    It must be possible to count all the connections in a given scope.

    Given Scope with ID 1
    And I have the following connections
        | clientId    | clientIp    | serverIp   | protocol | allowUserChange   |
        | testClient1 | 127.0.0.101 | 127.0.0.10 | tcp      | true              |

    Then No exception was thrown
    And I count 7 connections in scope 1

Scenario: Count connections in empty scope
    Counting connections for an empty (nonexisting) scope must not raise any exception.
    A regular result (in this case 0) must be returned.

    Given Scope with ID 1
    And I have the following connections
        | clientId    | clientIp    | serverIp   | protocol | allowUserChange   |

        | testClient7 | 127.0.0.107 | 127.0.0.10 | tcp      | true              |
    Then I count 0 connections in scope 42

Scenario: Try to change an existing connection ID
    It must not be possible to change the ID of an existing connection. Trying to
    do so must result in an exception being thrown.
