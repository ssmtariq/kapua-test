# MFA
mfaLoginTitle=Multi Factor Authentication Login

mfaHeaderHelp=Help
mfaFormBarcodeLabel= Multi factor authentication (MFA) is a process involving multiple stages to verify the identity of the user trying to access the Web Console.
mfaFormBarcodeLabel2= MFA can be enabled for a given user only by the user himself; no one can enable MFA for another user even with the credential:delete permission for the given account. However, an user with credential:delete permission can disable MFA for other users.
mfaFormBarcodeLabel3= To enable this extra security, follow these steps:
mfaFormBarcodeLabel4= 1. Download and install the Google Authenticator app for your smartphone
mfaFormBarcodeLabel5= 2. Click the enable button in the toolbar. You can only enable MFA for the current logged user, while a user with the credential:delete permission can disable MFA on any user covered by the permission.
mfaFormBarcodeLabel6= 3. When the QRCode is shown, open the Google Authenticator and add a new account by scanning the QRCode. Both the QRCode and the Scratch Codes will be shown only once, so make sure to have the generator application running and save the Scratch Codes somewhere before closing the dialog.
mfaFormBarcodeLabel7= On following Kapua Console logins, enter the user\u2019s credentials and the authentication code proposed by Google Authenticator. Scratch codes are one time codes that allows you to complete the login if you cannot produce an authentication code. A scratch code can only be used once; store pass codes safely.

mfaFormRevokeTrustedMachine=Revoke Trusted Devices
