Feature: JobEngineService stop job tests with online device
  Job Engine Service test scenarios for stopping job. This feature file contains scenarios for stopping job with one target and one step,
  one target and multiple steps, multiple targets and one step and multiple targets and multiple steps.

  Scenario: Stop job with multiple Bundle Start and Package Install steps and one target
  Create a new job and set a connected KuraMock device as the job target.
  Add Bundle Start and Package Install steps to the created job. Start the job.
  Before job is finished, stop the job. When job is stopped, the executed target's
  step index should be different than 1 and the status PROCESS_AWAITING. Start the job again.
  If job is finished step index should be 1, and the status PROCESS_OK.

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I start the Kura Mock
    And Device is connected
    And I wait 1 second
    And Device status is "CONNECTED"
    And I select account "kapua-sys"
    And I get the KuraMock device after 5 seconds
    And Bundles are requested
    Then A bundle named "slf4j.api" with id 34 and version "1.7.21" is present and "RESOLVED"
    And Packages are requested and 1 package is received
    When I search for events from device "rpione3" in account "kapua-sys" I find 3 events within 30 seconds
    And The type of the last event is "DEPLOY"
    And I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And I add target to job
    And I search for the job targets in database
    And I count 1

    And I create multiple new JobSteps from the existing creators
    Then No exception was thrown
    And I count the JobSteps and I find 2 JobStep within 30 seconds
    And I start a job
    And I wait for 10 milliseconds for processes to settle down
    And I stop the job
    And I search for the last job target in the database
    And I confirm the step index is 0 and status is "PROCESS_AWAITING"
    And I start a job
    And I confirm job target has step index 1 and status "PROCESS_OK" within 180 seconds
    When I query for the execution items for the current job and I count 2 or more finished within 30 seconds
    And Configuration is requested

    And Packages are requested and 0 packages are received
    Then KuraMock is disconnected
    And I logout

  Scenario: Stop job with multiple targets and Asset Write and Package Install steps and one target
  Create a new job and set a connected KuraMock device as the job target.
  Add two Asset Write and Package Install steps to the created job. Start the job.
  Before job is finished, stop the job. When job is stopped, the executed target's
  step index should be different than 1 and the status PROCESS_AWAITING. Start the job again.
  If job is finished step index should be 1, and job target status PROCESS_OK.

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I add 2 devices to Kura Mock
    And Devices are connected
    And I wait 1 second
    And Devices status is "CONNECTED"
    And I select account "kapua-sys"
    And I get the KuraMock devices after 5 seconds
