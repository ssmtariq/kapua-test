    # * Starting a job with one Target and one Step *
    # ***********************************************

  Scenario: Starting a job with valid Command Execution step
  Create a new job and set a connected KuraMock device as the job target.
  Add a new Command Execution step to the created job. Start the job.
  After the executed job is finished, the executed target's step index should
  be 0 and the status PROCESS_OK.

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I start the Kura Mock
    When Device is connected
    And I wait 1 second
    Then Device status is "CONNECTED"
    And I select account "kapua-sys"
    And I get the KuraMock device after 5 seconds
    When I search for events from device "rpione3" in account "kapua-sys" I find 1 event within 30 seconds
    And The type of the last event is "BIRTH"
