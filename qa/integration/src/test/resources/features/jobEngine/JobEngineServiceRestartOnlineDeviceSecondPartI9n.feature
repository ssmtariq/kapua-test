  Scenario: Restarting a job with valid Configuration Put step two times
  Create a new job and set a connected KuraMock device as the job target.
  Add a new valid Configuration Put step to the created job. Restart the job two times.
  After the executed job is finished, the executed target's step index should
  be 0 and the status PROCESS_OK

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I start the Kura Mock
    When Device is connected
    And I wait 1 second
    Then Device status is "CONNECTED"
    And I select account "kapua-sys"
    And I get the KuraMock device after 5 seconds
    Then Configuration is requested
    And A Configuration named "org.eclipse.kura.clock.ClockService" has property "clock.ntp.retry.interval" with value "5"
    When I search for events from device "rpione3" in account "kapua-sys" I find 2 events within 30 seconds
    And The type of the last event is "CONFIGURATION"
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And I create a new job target item
    And Search for step definition with the name "Configuration Put"
    And I prepare a JobStepCreator with the name "TestStep" and the following properties
