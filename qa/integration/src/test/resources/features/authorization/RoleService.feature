Feature: Role Service tests

@setup
Scenario: Initialize test environment
    Given Init Jaxb Context
    And Init Security Context

Scenario: Regular role creation
    Create a regular role entry. The entry must match the creator details.

    When I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    When I configure the role service
    | type    | name                       | value | scopeId |
    | boolean | infiniteChildEntities      | true  |    1    |
    | integer | maxNumberChildEntities     | 5     |    1    |
    And I create the domain
    | name        | actions             |
    | test        | read,write, execute |
    Given I create the following role
    | scopeId | name      | actions              |
    | 1       | test_role | write, read, connect |
    Then The role matches the creator
    When I examine the permissions for the last role
    Then I find the following actions
    | actions              |
    | write, read, connect |
    And The permissions match

Scenario: Nameless role entry
    It must not be possible to create a role entry without a name.
    Such an attempt must throw an exception.

    When I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    When I configure the role service

    | 1       | test_role | write, read, connect |
    When I search for the role with name "test_role"
    Then The correct role entry was found

Scenario: Search the role database for a random ID

    exception should be raised.

    When I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    When I configure the role service
    | type    | name                       | value | scopeId |
