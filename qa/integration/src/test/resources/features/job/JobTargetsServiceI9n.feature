Feature: Job Target service CRUD tests
  The Job service is responsible for maintaining a list of job targets.

  @setup
  Scenario: Init Security Context for all scenarios
    Given Init Jaxb Context
    And Init Security Context
    And Start base docker environment

  Scenario: Regular target creation

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I configure the job service
      | type    | name                   | value |
      | boolean | infiniteChildEntities  | true  |
      | integer | maxNumberChildEntities | 5     |
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And A regular job target item
    Then No exception was thrown
    And The job target matches the creator
    Then I logout

  Scenario: Target with a null scope ID

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I configure the job service
      | type    | name                   | value |
      | boolean | infiniteChildEntities  | true  |
      | integer | maxNumberChildEntities | 5     |
    Given A null scope
    Given I expect the exception "KapuaIllegalNullArgumentException" with the text "scopeId"
    When I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    Then An exception was thrown
    Then I logout

  Scenario: Delete a job target

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I configure the job service
      | type    | name                   | value |
      | boolean | infiniteChildEntities  | true  |
      | integer | maxNumberChildEntities | 5     |
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And A regular job target item
    When I delete the last job target in the database
    And I search for the last job target in the database
    Then There is no such job target item in the database
    Then I logout

  Scenario: Delete a job target twice

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I configure the job service
      | type    | name                   | value |
      | boolean | infiniteChildEntities  | true  |
      | integer | maxNumberChildEntities | 5     |
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And A regular job target item
    When I delete the last job target in the database
    Given I expect the exception "KapuaEntityNotFoundException" with the text "type jobTarget"
    When I delete the last job target in the database
    Then An exception was thrown
    Then I logout

  Scenario: Create and count multiple job targets

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I configure the job service
      | type    | name                   | value |
      | boolean | infiniteChildEntities  | true  |
      | integer | maxNumberChildEntities | 5     |
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob"
    And A regular job target item
    And A regular job target item
    And A regular job target item
    And A regular job target item
    When I count the targets in the current scope
    Then I count 4
    Then I logout

  Scenario: Query for the targets of a specific job

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I configure the job service
      | type    | name                   | value |
      | boolean | infiniteChildEntities  | true  |
      | integer | maxNumberChildEntities | 5     |
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob1"
    And A regular job target item
    And A regular job target item
    And A regular job target item
    And A regular job target item
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob2"
    And A regular job target item
    And A regular job target item
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob3"
    And A regular job target item
    And A regular job target item
    And A regular job target item
    Given I query for the job with the name "TestJob2"
    When I query the targets for the current job
    Then I count 2
    Given I query for the job with the name "TestJob1"
    When I query the targets for the current job
    Then I count 4
    Then I logout

  Scenario: Update a job target step index

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
    And I configure the job service
      | type    | name                   | value |
      | boolean | infiniteChildEntities  | true  |
      | integer | maxNumberChildEntities | 5     |
    Given I create a job with the name "TestJob1"
    And A regular job target item
    When I update the job target step number to 3
    Then The target step index is indeed 3
    Then I logout

  Scenario: Update a job target status

    Given I login as user with name "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password"
