Feature: Broker ACL tests
  These tests are validating correct access control rights of broker security.
  User with one or more profile connects to the broker and tries to issue actions such as
  publish and subscribe to topics, manage topic. Based on his profile these actions are
  successful or not.

    This means that foo topic is not created as data view has no admin rights on this topic.
    Given Mqtt Device is started
      And data view account and user are created
    When broker with clientId "client-1" and user "luise" and password "KeepCalm123." is listening on topic ""
      And string "Hello broker" is published to topic "$EDC/acme/foo" with client "client-1"
      And I wait 1 second
    Then Broker doesn't receive string "Hello broker" on topic "$EDC/acme/foo"
      And clients are disconnected
      And Mqtt Device is stoped

  Scenario: DV7 Data view subscribe on CTRL_ACC is not allowed
    Normal user with data view profile subscribes to $EDC.{0}.>
    Subscribe is not allowed.
    Given Mqtt Device is started
      And data view account and user are created
    Given I expect the exception "MqttException" with the text "*"
    When broker with clientId "client-1" and user "luise" and password "KeepCalm123." is listening on topic "$EDC/acme"
    Then An exception was thrown
      And clients are disconnected
      And Mqtt Device is stoped

  Scenario: DV8 Data view subscribe - publish - admin on CTRL_ACC_CLI
    Normal user with data view profile subscribes to $EDC.{0}.{1}.> and at the same time
    publishes to subtopic foo. All this operations are allowed.
    Given Mqtt Device is started
      And data view account and user are created
    When broker with clientId "client-1" and user "luise" and password "KeepCalm123." is listening on topic "$EDC/acme/client-1/foo"
      And string "Hello broker" is published to topic "$EDC/acme/client-1/foo" with client "client-1"
      And I wait 1 second
    Then client "client-1" receives string "Hello broker" on topic "$EDC/acme/client-1/foo"
      And clients are disconnected
      And Mqtt Device is stoped

  Scenario: DV9 Data view publish to ACL_DATA_ACC is not allowed
    Normal user with data view profile publishes to topic {0}.>
    Given Mqtt Device is started
      And data view account and user are created
    When broker with clientId "client-1" and user "luise" and password "KeepCalm123." is listening on topic ""
      And string "Hello broker" is published to topic "acme" with client "client-1"
      And I wait 1 second
    Then Broker doesn't receive string "Hello broker" on topic "acme"
      And clients are disconnected
      And Mqtt Device is stoped

  Scenario: DV10 Data view create sub-topic on ACL_DATA_ACC is allowed
    Normal user with data view profile publishes to topic {0}.foo
    This means that foo topic is created as broker has admin rights on this topic, but
    message is not received as publish is not allowed. How is this scenario possible?
    Given Mqtt Device is started
      And data view account and user are created
    When broker with clientId "client-1" and user "luise" and password "KeepCalm123." is listening on topic ""
      And string "Hello broker" is published to topic "acme/foo" with client "client-1"
      And I wait 1 second
    Then Broker doesn't receive string "Hello broker" on topic "acme/foo"
      And clients are disconnected
      And Mqtt Device is stoped

  Scenario: DV11 Data view subscribe on ACL_DATA_ACC is allowed
    Normal user with data view profile subscribes to {0}.> Admin user publishes to this topic and message
    is received by listening client.
    Given Mqtt Device is started
      And data view account and user are created
    When broker with clientId "client-1" and user "luise" and password "KeepCalm123." is listening on topic "acme"
      And broker with clientId "admin-1" and user "kapua-sys" and password "kapua-password" is listening on topic ""
      And string "Hello broker" is published to topic "acme" with client "admin-1"
      And I wait 1 second
    Then client "client-1" receives string "Hello broker" on topic "acme"
      And clients are disconnected
      And Mqtt Device is stoped

  Scenario: DV12 Data view publish to ACL_CTRL_ACC_CLI is allowed
    Normal user with data view profile publishes to topic {0}.{1}.>
    Publish is allowed, but not subscribe and admin.
    Given Mqtt Device is started
      And data view account and user are created
    When broker with clientId "client-1" and user "luise" and password "KeepCalm123." is listening on topic ""
      And string "Hello broker" is published to topic "acme/client-1" with client "client-1"
      And I wait 1 second
    Then Broker receives string "Hello broker" on topic "acme/client-1"
      And clients are disconnected
      And Mqtt Device is stoped

  Scenario: DV13 Data view create sub-topic on ACL_CTRL_ACC_CLI is not allowed
    Normal user with data view profile publishes to topic {0}.{1}.foo
    This means that foo topic is not created as data view has no admin rights on this topic.
    Because user also has broker connect privilege it out-rules this ACL and can admin this topic.
    Is this correct behaviour?
    Given Mqtt Device is started
      And data view account and user are created
    When broker with clientId "client-1" and user "luise" and password "KeepCalm123." is listening on topic ""
      And string "Hello broker" is published to topic "acme/client-1/foo" with client "client-1"
      And I wait 1 second
    Then Broker receives string "Hello broker" on topic "acme/client-1/foo"
      And clients are disconnected
      And Mqtt Device is stoped

#  Scenario: DV14 Data view subscribe on ACL_CTRL_ACC_CLI is not allowed
#    Normal user with data view profile subscribes to {0}.{1}.>
#    Because user also has broker connect privilege it out-rules this ACL and can subscribe to this topic.
#    This out-roule is not applied? Why?
#    Given Mqtt Device is started

    Normal user with data view profile publishes to topic $EDC.{0}.*.*.NOTIFY.{1}.>
    Publish is allowed, but not subscribe and admin.
    Given Mqtt Device is started

    When broker with clientId "client-1" and user "luise" and password "KeepCalm123." is listening on topic ""
      And string "Hello broker" is published to topic "$EDC/acme/foo/bar/NOTIFY/client-1" with client "client-1"
      And I wait 1 second
    Then Broker receives string "Hello broker" on topic "$EDC/acme/foo/bar/NOTIFY/client-1"
      And clients are disconnected
      And Mqtt Device is stoped

#  Scenario: DV16 Data view create sub-topic on ACL_CTRL_ACC_NOTIFY is not allowed
#    Normal user with data view profile publishes to topic $EDC.{0}.*.*.NOTIFY.{1}.foo
#    This means that foo topic is not created as data view has no admin rights on this topic.

  Scenario: DV17 Data view subscribe on ACL_CTRL_ACC_NOTIFY is not allowed
    Normal user with data view profile subscribes to $EDC.{0}.*.*.NOTIFY.{1}.>
    Subscribe is not allowed.
    Given Mqtt Device is started
      And data view account and user are created
    Given I expect the exception "MqttException" with the text "*"
    When broker with clientId "client-1" and user "luise" and password "KeepCalm123." is listening on topic "$EDC/acme/foo/bar/NOTIFY/client-1"
    Then An exception was thrown
