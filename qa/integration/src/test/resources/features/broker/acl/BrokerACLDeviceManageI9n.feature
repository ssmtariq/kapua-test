Feature: Broker ACL tests
  These tests are validating correct access control rights of broker security.
  User with one or more profile connects to the broker and tries to issue actions such as
  publish and subscribe to topics, manage topic. Based on his profile these actions are
  successful or not.
  This part of tests is meant for Device manage profile
  --
  Profile:
  broker connect  B
  device manage   DEV_M
  data view       DATA_V
  data manage     DATA_M

  and this is allowed.
    Given Mqtt Device is started
    And data manage account and user are created
    When broker with clientId "client-1" and user "luise" and password "KeepCalm123." is listening on topic ""
    And string "Hello broker" is published to topic "$EDC/acme/client-1/CONF-V1/REPLY" with client "client-1"
    And 1 second passed for message to arrive
