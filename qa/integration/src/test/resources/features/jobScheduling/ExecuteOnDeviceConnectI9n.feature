  Scenario: Executing Job When Device Connected After The Specified Start Date And Time
  Login as the kapua-sys user and create a new job with a Command Execution job step.
  Define a new "Device Connect" schedule and add it to the created job.
  The schedule should have a start date in the past and no defined end date.
  Add a previously disconnected KuraMock device as the job target.
  After the restart of the KuraMock device the job should be started.
  The execution of the job should be confirmed, the job targets step index should be
  0 and status PROCESS_OK.
