    Then I store the messages from list "TestMessages" and remember the IDs as "StoredMessageIDs"
    And I refresh all indices
    When I query for the current account messages with limit 1 and offset 0 and store them as "MessageInfo"
    Then The message list "MessageInfo" have limitExceed value true
    And I delete all indices

  Scenario: Create 4 messages, query all messages with offset 0 and limit 4
    Check if value of limitExceed is false.
